Virtual notebook with notes, changelogs, or wishlists related to my life or infrastructure I maintain


## About

This is a small repository to collect a majority of my digital notes.
Some of them are about things I have read, which you might find useful.
Others are infrastructure notes, which are mostly useful to me.

Currently, I do not accept pull requests to reserve my right in changing the license of this text in the future.
If something seems wrong, please open an issue.
